# Best Practices for Discord Bot Lists
*Bot lists must meet these minimum requirements to be considered a bot list.*

---

Your bot list:

1. Must have a respectable TLD.
  - Free TLDs such as `.tk` or `.ga` are probibited
2. Must not be a `[xyz].glitch.me` domain.
  - Glitch is acceptable if:
     - Uptime is immaculate
     - A custom domain name is used (whilst still following point `1`)
3. Should not display all bots on the homepage.
4. Must be fully functioning.
  - No broken links/buttons.
5. Must have consistent uptime.
  - Minor downtime for fixing a problem is fine
