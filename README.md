# Best Practices for Discord Bot Lists
*Bot lists must meet these minimum requirements to be considered a bot list.*

---
Your bot list...
1. must have a respectable TLD.
  - .tk TLDs are not allowed.
  - No subdomains (botlist.domain.com)
2. can **NOT** be hosted on glitch.
3. should not display all the listed bots on the front page.
4. must be usable. No broken links/buttons.
  - It should work on all commonly used browsers (Chrome, Opera and yes even Edge)
5. must have consistent uptime.
  - Minor downtime due to fixes or maintenance are ok.
6. should have an easy to understand API-Documentation, if an API is available.
7. can **NOT** be a clone of an already existing (open source) bot list.
